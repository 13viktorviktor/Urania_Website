                URANIA<br>
                URANIA is an interdisciplinary project in which fashion, art, design and music meet in a new way of formulating imaginaries that challenges the canons and habits with which fashion itself is codified.
                <br><br><br>
                It's a fashion project that questions the principles of authorship and new.<br>
                It's collaborative with the ambition to become a communitarian.<br>
                It's a series of limited editions.<br>
                It's the archive, which does not end up in the museum's display cases, as a design tool and a place for theoretical reflection.<br>
                It's Menard's Quixote – it questions us about the meaning of the object in relation to time.<br>
                It's a sign that it changes meaning in relation to the bodies that dress it and the context/spectator.<br>
                It's ready-made.<br>
                It's eco-friendly – and it's neither recycling/down-cycling.<br>
                It does not increase the value of the garment in aesthetic terms with the rhetoric of upcycling, but it restores the original value of the object.<br>
                It's political.<br>
                It's out of the fashion industry.<br>
                It's a research into new ways of designing.<br>
                It's cheap and exclusive.<br>
                It's one of a kind.<br>
                It's original.<br>
                It's ready-to-wear.<br>
                It's hacking.<br>
                It's a declaration of love for the original.<br>
                It's a reflection between true and fake.<br>
                It's see now and buy now.<br>
                It's to see clothes from another point of view as the Webler's statement taken up by Goldsmith takes on a new meaning.<br>
                It's an universal wardrobe.<br>
                It's a collective memory.<br>
                It's a short circuit of a compromised system.<br>
                It's a Favaretto core of the stratified history of fashion and costume, preserved and which becomes a message for the near future.<br>
                It's a printed rock by Trevisani.<br>
                It's of known and unknown origin.<br>
                It's FABIO QUARANTA, Raf Simons and Comme des Garçons as are Caraceni and Litrico.<br>
                It's made everywhere.<br>
                It already exist.<br>
                It does not produce any new garments.<br>
